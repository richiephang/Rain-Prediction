Fuzzy logic system for rain prediction 

This is a project about rain prediction fuzzy logic system using a Mamdani inference engine.

Inputs:
1)	Temperature: The average atmospheric temperature of the past hour in Degree Celsius.
2)	Humidity: The average atmospheric humidity of the past hour in percentage.
3)	Wind Speed: The average wind speed of the past hour in kilometres per hour.
4)	UV Index: The average UV Index of the past hour.

Output:
Rain probability %
